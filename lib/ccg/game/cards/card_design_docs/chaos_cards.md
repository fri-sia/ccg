# Chaos cards
A set of cards all with the following effect as base:

> If NAME has no chaos counters on it, you may play the top card of your deck into a random lane and put a chaos counter on NAME.

Then, they would all have a secondary effect which would benefit from chaos counters. Example:

> NAME gains +2 {:attack} for each chaos counter on it.

## Support ideas
> **Chaos Commander**
> When NAME enters the battlefield, remove all chaos counters on the field. Then, distribute the same amount of chaos counters that you removed randomly among chaos permanents you control, except NAME

> **Erosion Lands**
> ACTIVE: Play a random card from your hand into a random lane, and then put a chaos counter on NAME
> ACTIVE: Remove a chaos counter from NAME, then all players plays a random card from their hand into a random lane instead of their normal play.
